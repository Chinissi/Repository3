To install using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), you'll first need to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) on your system.

Install with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add prettier --dev --exact
# or globally
yarn global add prettier
```

You can also install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) if you like:_

```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
# or globally
npm install --global prettier
```

> We recommend pinning an exact version of prettier in your `package.json` as we introduce stylistic changes in patch releases.
