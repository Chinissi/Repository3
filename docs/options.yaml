single-quote: |
  Notes:
  * Quotes in JSX will always be double and ignore this setting.
  * If the number of quotes outweighs the other quote, the quote which is less used will be used to format the string - Example: `"I'm double quoted"` results in `"I'm double quoted"` and `"This \"example\" is single quoted"` results in `'This "example" is single quoted'`.

parser: |
  Both the `babylon` and `flow` parsers support the same set of JavaScript
  features (including Flow). Prettier automatically infers the parser from the
  input file path, so you shouldn't have to change this setting.

filepath: |
  For example, the following will use `postcss` parser:

  ```bash
  cat foo | prettier --stdin-filepath foo.css
  ```

require-pragma: |
  Prettier can restrict itself to only format files that contain a special comment, called a pragma, at the top of the file. This is very useful
  when gradually transitioning large, unformatted codebases to prettier.

  For example, a file with the following as its first comment will be formatted when `--require-pragma` is supplied:

  ```js
  /**
   * @prettier
   */
  ```

  or

  ```js
  /**
   * @format
   */
  ```
