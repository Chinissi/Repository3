#### Support shared config that forbids `require()` (#15233 by @fisker)

If an external shared config package is used, and the package `exports` don't have `require` or `default` export.

In Prettier stable Prettier fails when attempt to `require()` the package, and throws an error.

```text
Error [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: No "exports" main defined in <packageName>/package.json
```
