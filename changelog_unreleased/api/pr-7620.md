#### Remove the `version` parameter of `prettier.getSupportInfo()` ([#7620](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7620) by [@thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0))

In Prettier 1.x (since 1.8.0), it was possible to pass a version number to `prettier.getSupportInfo()` to get information on the languages, options, etc. supported by previous versions. This feature has been virtually unused while the maintenance burden it caused was significant. In Prettier 2.0.0, this parameter has been removed.
