#### Change default value for `trailingComma` to `es5` ([#6963](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/6963) by [@fisker](https://github.com/fisker))

Before v2.0, Prettier was avoiding trailing commas by default where possible.
This made the resulting javascript compatible with now very old environments such as IE8, but implied [missed opportunities for code collaborators](https://medium.com/@nikgraf/why-you-should-enforce-dangling-commas-for-multiline-statements-d034c98e36f8).

Prettier includes an [option to configure trailing commas](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#trailing-commas) since its early days, and an initiative to change the default value has been out there [for over three years](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/68).
Finally, the default value becomes `es5` instead of `none` in Prettier v2.0.

If the old behavior is still preferred, please configure Prettier with `{ "trailingComma": "none" }`.
There is a possibility that the default value will change to `always` (even more trailing commas) in a future major version of Prettier as the JavaScript ecosystem further matures.
