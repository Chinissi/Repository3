#### A plugin's `print` can accept different `AstPath` objects (#14230 by @siefkenj)

Plugins are passed a `print` function which can be used to recursively apply printing
functions. This print function was previously bound to a single `AstPath` object (the
root `AstPath`). The print function now accepts any `AstPath` object and will continue
printing based on that object.

```javascript
function pluginPrint(path, options, print) {
  const newAst = createNewAst(path.getNode());
  const newPath = new path.constructor(newAst);
  return print(newPath);
}
```
