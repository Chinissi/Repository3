#### Change default value for `useTabs` to `true` ([#7476](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7476) by [@ExE-Boss](https://github.com/ExE-Boss))

Before version 2.0, Prettier was using spaces to indent code by default.

This has several disadvantages, most notably an increased file size.

You are encouraged to use the new default value, but if the old behavior is still preferred, please configure Prettier with `{ "useTabs": false }`.
