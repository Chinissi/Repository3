#### ESM standalone bundles ([#8983](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/8983) by [@Monchi](https://github.com/Monchi))

Now standalone is also bundled as ESM. It works directly on browser.

```js
import prettier from "prettier/standalone";
import parserGraphql from "prettier/parser-graphql";

prettier.format("query {     }", {
  parser: "graphql",
  plugins: [parserGraphql],
});
```
