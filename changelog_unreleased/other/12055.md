#### Switch to `esbuild` (#12055 by @fisker)

We've switched our build process from Rollup to [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io). esbuild is much faster and has improved our development experience. This is an internal change and should not affect users. If something isnâ€™t working for you after upgrading, please [open an issue](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=integration.md)!
