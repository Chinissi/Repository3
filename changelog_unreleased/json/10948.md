#### Special format `cspell.json` file (#10948 by @fisker)

If we run Prettier over `cspell.json` file with Prettier stable, a final new line will be inserted.

Due to [a bug in Spelling Checker for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/issues/391), when we update this file in VS Code, the final new line will be removed.

Prettier main won't print the final new line for it.
