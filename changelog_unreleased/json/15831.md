#### New `jsonc` parser added (#15831 by @fisker)

Previously, we infer the parser of `.jsonc` files to be `json`, but if we want keep the trailing comma, we'll have to use a hacky workaround to config `{parser: "json5", quoteProps: "preserve", singleQuote: false}`.

The new added `jsonc` parser will always quote the object keys and wrap strings with double quotes to match the JSONC language specification.
