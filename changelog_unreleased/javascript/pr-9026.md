#### add parents around mixed operators with division for readability ([#9026](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/9026) by [@brad-decker](https://github.com/brad-decker))

When mixed operators include division and addition or subtraction, wrap the division in parenthesis for readability.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
x + y / 2;

// Prettier stable
x + y / 2;

// Prettier master
x + (y / 2);
```
