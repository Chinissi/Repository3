#### Fix parentheses around sequence expression as body of arrow chain (#11593 by @bakkot)

The required parentheses around sequence expressions as the body of arrow functions are now preserved for chained arrows. Previously, Prettier removed them, which resulted in invalid syntax.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
const f = () => () => (0, 1);

// Prettier stable
const f = () => () => 0, 1;

// Prettier main
const f = () => () => (0, 1);
```
