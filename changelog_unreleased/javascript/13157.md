#### Fix line breaks in multiline strings aren't replaced with literalline and confuse fits (#13157 by @thorn0 )

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Note that it's not about template literals. It's about normal string literals with escaped line breaks.
Prettier 2.7.1

Input:

```js
const loremIpsumFooBazBar1 = 'Multiline string\
         Multiline string\
'

const loremIpsumFooBazBar2 = 'Multiline string\
         Multiline string\
         Multiline string'
```
Output:
```js
const loremIpsumFooBazBar1 = "Multiline string\
         Multiline string\
";

const loremIpsumFooBazBar2 =
  "Multiline string\
         Multiline string\
         Multiline string";
```
Expected behavior:
Formatting style shouldn't change when more lines are added.
