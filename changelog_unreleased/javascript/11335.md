#### Support hack-style pipeline proposal (#11335 by @sosukesuzuki)

The proposed [hack-style pipeline syntax](https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-hack-pipes) is now supported by Prettier. We are using `%` as the topic token, following the official explainer — although this may change in future releases as the proposal progresses.

As part of this change, support for the [“smart” pipeline syntax](https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-smart-pipelines) has been removed. See [our policy on non-standardized syntax](https://prettier.io/docs/en/rationale.html#disclaimer-about-non-standard-syntax) for the rationale behind this decision.

```js
// Input
const foo = fn() |> fn1(%) |> fn2(%);

// Prettier stable
SyntaxError: Unexpected token (1:25)
> 1 | const foo = fn() |> fn1(%) |> fn2(%);
    |                         ^
  2 |

// Prettier main
const foo = fn() |> fn1(%) |> fn(%);

```
