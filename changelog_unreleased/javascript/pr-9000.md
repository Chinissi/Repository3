#### Add `espree` parser (#9000 by @fisker)

A new value for the `parser` option has been added: `espree`.[`espree`](https://github.com/eslint/espree) is the [`ESLint`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) default parser, note that `espree` only works for [ECMAScript Finished Proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md), and it's stricter than `babel` parser.
