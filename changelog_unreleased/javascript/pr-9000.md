#### [HIGHLIGHT]Add `espree` parser (#9000 by @fisker)

A new value for the `parser` option has been added: [`espree`](https://github.com/eslint/espree) - which is the default parser used by [`ESLint`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Note that `espree` only works for [Finished ECMAScript Proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md), and is stricter than the `babel` parser.
