#### Force line breaks for nested await expressions in member/call expression heads (#10342 by @thorn0)

Even though Prettier tries to be helpful here, please don't write code like this. Have mercy upon your teammates and use intermediate variables.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
const getAccountCount = async () =>
  (await
    (await (
      await focusOnSection(BOOKMARKED_PROJECTS_SECTION_NAME)
    ).findItem("My bookmarks")).getChildren()
  ).length

// Prettier stable
const getAccountCount = async () =>
  (
    await (
      await (await focusOnSection(BOOKMARKED_PROJECTS_SECTION_NAME)).findItem(
        "My bookmarks"
      )
    ).getChildren()
  ).length;

// Prettier main
const getAccountCount = async () =>
  (
    await (
      await (
        await focusOnSection(BOOKMARKED_PROJECTS_SECTION_NAME)
      ).findItem("My bookmarks")
    ).getChildren()
  ).length;
```
