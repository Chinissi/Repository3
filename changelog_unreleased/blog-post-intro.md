title: "Prettier 2.6: new singleAttributePerLine option and new JavaScript features!"
---

This release includes a new `singleAttributePerLine` option. For us, adding a new option was a hard decision.

We've also support formatting for some new ECMAScript proposals via Babel.

If you enjoy Prettier and would like to support our work, consider sponsoring us directly via [our OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/prettier) or by sponsoring the projects we depend on, including [typescript-eslint](https://opencollective.com/typescript-eslint), [remark](https://opencollective.com/unified), and [Babel](https://opencollective.com/babel).

Please see our previously posted blog [Prettier begins paying maintainers](https://prettier.io/blog/2022/01/06/prettier-begins-paying-maintainers.html) on how we use our funds.
