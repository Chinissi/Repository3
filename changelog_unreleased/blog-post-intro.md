title: "Prettier 2.4: new bracketSameLine option and TypeScript 4.4 support!"
---

This release adds new `bracketSameLine` option! And `jsxBracketSameLine` is deprecated.`bracketSameLine` is generic version of the `jsxBracketSameLine` option that works for HTML, JSX, Vue, and Angular.

Also we supports [TypeScript 4.4](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-4.html). This allows for the formatting of Stage 4 [Class Static Blocks](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-static-block).

If you enjoy Prettier and would like to support our work, head to our [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/prettier). Please consider also supporting the projects Prettier depends on, such as [typescript-eslint](https://opencollective.com/typescript-eslint), [remark](https://opencollective.com/unified), and [Babel](https://opencollective.com/babel).
