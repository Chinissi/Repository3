title: "Prettier 3.1: New experimental ternaries formatting!"
---

This release adds indentation back to nested ternaries along with a new `--experimental-ternaries` flag to try a more novel "curious ternary" format that scales better to deeply nested conditionals.

We are keen for [your feedback](https://forms.gle/vwEuboCobTVhEkt66) on the experimental format before it rolls out as the default behavior later this year!
