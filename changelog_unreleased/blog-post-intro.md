title: "Prettier 2.8: improve --cache CLI option and TypeScript 4.9 syntax!"
---

This release includes includes improvements to the `--cache` option added in 2.7. A new `--cache-location` has been added, and a bug that saves cache even when without `--write` option has been fixed.

We've also added support formatting for TypeScript 4.9 syntax!
