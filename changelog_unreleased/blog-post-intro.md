title: "Prettier 2.7: new --cache CLI option and TypeScript 4.7 syntax!"
---

This release includes a new `--cache` CLI option. Enabling this option will use some attributes as cache keys and format files only if they have changed. This could dramatically improve CLI performance.

We've also added support formatting for TypeScript 4.7 syntax!
