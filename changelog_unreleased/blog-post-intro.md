title: "Prettier 3.2: Support JSONC and Angular’s ICU expression"
---

This release includes new features such as adding a JSONC parser, adding Angular’s ICU expressions, and many bug fixes.

We are still seeking feedback for the `--experimental-ternaries` option released in Prettier 3.1. Please read [A curious case of the ternaries](https://prettier.io/blog/2023/11/13/curious-ternaries) and respond via the Google Forms link provided.

Additionally, we recommend reading [Prettier's CLI: A Performance Deep Dive](https://prettier.io/blog/2023/11/30/cli-deep-dive) by [Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato). This faster CLI is slated to be released as version 4.0.
