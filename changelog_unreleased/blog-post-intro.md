This version includes breaking changes. For example, the default value of `trailingComma` is now `all`!

In particular, the plugin interface has changed significantly. We now supports plugins written with ECMAScript Modules and async parsers. If you are a plugin developer, please be careful when updating. Bug reports and feedback are welcome.

In addition, many formatting improvements and bug fixes are included.
