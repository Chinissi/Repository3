#### Add support for MDX 2 comments (#11563 by @wooorm)

This adds support for MDX 2 comments (which are the same as other comments
inside JSX) in addition to existing MDX 1 comments (HTML-like constructs).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```mdx
Input:

{/*A comment*/}

Prettier stable:

{/_A comment_/}

Prettier main:
{/*A comment*/}
```
