#### Add support for MDX 2 comments (#11563 by @wooorm)

This adds basic support for MDX 2 comments (JavaScript-style comments) in
addition to existing MDX 1 comments (HTML-style comments).

Note that in MDX 2, more complex comments and whole expressions can be used
inside braces.
This currently only supports a single comment on one line so that
`{/* prettier-ignore */}` can be used, but doesnâ€™t support most of MDX 2.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```mdx
Input:

{/*A comment*/}

Prettier stable:

{/_A comment_/}

Prettier main:
{/*A comment*/}
```
