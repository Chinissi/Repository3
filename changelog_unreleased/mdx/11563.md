#### [HIGHLIGHT]Add support for MDX 2 comments (#11563 by @wooorm)

This adds basic support for MDX v2 comment syntax (JavaScript-style comments) in addition to the existing support MDX v1 comment syntax (HTML-style comments).

Note that in MDX 2, more complex comments and whole expressions can be used inside braces.
This currently only supports a single comment on one line so that `{/* prettier-ignore */}` can be used, but doesnâ€™t support most of MDX 2.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```mdx
Input:
{/*A comment*/}

Prettier stable:
{/_A comment_/}

Prettier main:
{/*A comment*/}
```
