1. Choose a folder based on which language your PR is for.

   - For JavaScript, choose `javascript/` etc.
   - For TypeScript specific syntax, choose `typescript/`.
   - If your PR applies to multiple languages, such as TypeScript/Flow, choose one folder and mention which languages it applies to.

2. In your chosen folder, create a file with your PR number: `XXXX.md`. For example: `typescript/6728.md`.

3. Copy the content below and paste it in your new file.

4. Fill in a title, the PR number and your user name.

5. Optionally write a description. Many times it’s enough with just sample code.

6. Change ```jsx to your language. For example, ```yaml.

7. Change the `// Input` and `// Prettier` comments to the comment syntax of your language. For example, `# Input`.

8. Choose some nice input example code. Paste it along with the output before and after your PR.

# Print the number of files that need formatting. (#12561 by @Harry-Hopkinson)

## Description

This change prints the number of files that need to be changed in order to match the Prettier Code Style.

For example if you

```shell
prettier --check <a directory>
```

Now if one file needs to be changed it prints out.
Code style issues found in the above file. Forgot to run Prettier?

Instead of
Code style issues found in the above file(s). Forgot to run Prettier?

Another change is it now prints out the number of files that need to be formatted. For example if you have three files that need to be formatted in a directory it now outputs the number of files that need to change.

```shell
Code style issues found in 3 files. Forgot to run Prettier?
```

This is in contrast to the previous

```shell
Code style issues fixed in the above file(s). Forgot to run Prettier?
```
