#### Print the number of files that need formatting. (#12561 by @Harry-Hopkinson)

<!-- Optional description if it makes sense. -->

This change prints the number of files that need to be changed in order to match the Prettier Code Style.

For example if you

```shell
prettier --check <a directory>
```

Now if one file needs to be changed it prints out.
Code style issues found in the above file. Forgot to run Prettier?

Instead of
Code style issues found in the above file(s). Forgot to run Prettier?

Another change is it now prints out the number of files that need to be formatted. For example if you have three files that need to be formatted in a directory it now outputs the number of files that need to change.

```shell
Code style issues found in 3 files. Forgot to run Prettier?
```

This is in contrast to the previous

````shell
Code style issues fixed in the above file(s). Forgot to run Prettier?
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
(foo ?? baz) || baz;

// Prettier stable
foo ?? baz || baz;

// Prettier main
(foo ?? baz) || baz;
````
