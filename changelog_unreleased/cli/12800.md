#### Add new `--cache` (#12800 by @sosukesuzuki)

Two new CLI options have been added for a caching system similar to [ESLint's one](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#caching). Please see the [documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html#--cache) for details.

##### `--cache`

When you want to format only changed files, you can run Prettier with `--cache` flag. Enabling this flag can dramatically improve running time.

```bash
prettier --write --cache src
```
