#### [HIGHLIGHT]Add `--cache` and `--cache-strategy` CLI option (#12800 by @sosukesuzuki)

Two new CLI options have been added for a caching system similar to [ESLint's one](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#caching).

##### `--cache`

If this option is enabled, the following values are used as cache keys and the file is formatted only if one of them is changed.

- Prettier version
- Options
- Node.js version
- (if `--cache-strategy` is `content`) content of the file
- (if `--cache-strategy` is `metadata`) file metadata, such as timestamps

```bash
prettier --write --cache src
```

##### `--cache-strategy`

Strategy for the cache to use for detecting changed files. Can be either `metadata` or `content`. If no strategy is specified, `content` will be used.

```bash
prettier --write --cache --cache-strategy metadata src
```
