#### Skip explicitly passed symbolic links with `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` (#15533 by @sanmai-NL)

In Prettier stable, we stopped follow symbolic links, how ever in some use case, then symbolic link patterns can't be filter out, and there is no way prevent prettier throw errors.

In Prettier main, you can use `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` to simply skip it.
