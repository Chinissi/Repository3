#### Process files only supported by plugins (#15533 by @sanmai-NL)

In #14627, Prettier was redesigned to ‘no longer follow symbolic links’. However, the implementation went further and turned into a breaking change. Rather than adhering to the exit status contract of only returning a non-zero exit status when a file is not formatted or when something is wrong with Prettier itself, #14627 made Prettier return a non-zero exit status upon any pattern turning out to be a pointing to symlink.

In case `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` is set, Prettier no longer always has a non-zero exit status if patterns match symlinks.
