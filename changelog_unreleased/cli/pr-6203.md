#### API/CLI: `.prettierignore` now resolves upwards like `.gitignore` ([#6203](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/6203) by [@bmalehorn])

When deciding to ignore a file, allow `.prettierignore` files at any directory, not just the current directory. This allows users to put general rules in the root of the repository, then override them in subdirectories.

This can also change whether or not some files are ignored.

In the old behavior, only the `.prettierignore` in the current directory was used. To get the old behavior back, set `--ignore-path` to `.prettierignore`:

```shell
yarn --ignore-path .prettierignore
```

```js
getFileInfo(filePath, { ignorePath: ".prettierignore" });
```
