#### Print out How Many Unformatted Files do not apply to the Prettier Configuration. (#12350 by @Harry-Hopkinson)

If there is only one formatted file - print out "Code style issues fixed in the above file" instead of "Code style issues fixed in the above file(s)."

If there is two or more files that need to be formatted. Display

```js
"Code style issues found in " +
  numberOfUnformattedFilesFound +
  " files. Forgot to run Prettier?";
```

Example output = "Code Style Issues found in five files. Forgot to run Prettier?"
