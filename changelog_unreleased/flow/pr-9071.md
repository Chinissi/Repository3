#### Switch the `babel` parser to `babel-flow` if the `@flow` pragma is found ([#9071](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/9071) by [@fisker](https://github.com/fisker))

In practice, this means that as long as your Flow files have the pragma, it's safe to use the `.js` extension for them. Prettier will correctly parse and print them without any additional configuration. Previously, the pragma was recognized by the parser, but there existed minor correctness issues with the printer.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
// @flow
f<T>({ "2": 2 })

// Prettier stable
// @flow
f<T>({ 2: 2 });

// Prettier master
// @flow
f<T>({ "2": 2 });
```

Note that it's not safe to unquote number keys in Flow.
