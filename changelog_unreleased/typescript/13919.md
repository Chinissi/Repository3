#### Support auto accessors syntax (#13919 by @sosukesuzuki)

Support for [Auto Accessors Syntax](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-9/#auto-accessors-in-classes) landed in TypeScript 4.9.

(Doesn't work well with `babel-ts` parser)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
class Foo {
  accessor foo: number = 3;
}
```
