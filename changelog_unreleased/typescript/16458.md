#### Add parentheses for some expressions in decorators (#16429) (#16458 by @y-schneider)

Prevent parentheses around member expressions or tagged template literals from being removed to follow the stricter parsing rules of TypeScript 5.5.
If parentheses are needed and missing, they are added as well.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Input
@(foo`tagged template`)
class X {}

// Prettier stable
@foo`tagged template`
class X {}

// Prettier main
@(foo`tagged template`)
class X {}
```
