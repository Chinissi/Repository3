#### [HIGHLIGHT]TypeScript 4.6 support (#12400 by @dependabot)

Weâ€™ve updated the version of TypeScript that we use to parse TS code to [TypeScript 4.6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-6/). However, no new syntax was added in this release of TypeScript so we have not had to make any other changes.
