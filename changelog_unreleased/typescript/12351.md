#### Refactor printing definite assignment assertions (#12351 by @thorn0)

Definite assignment assertions are now printed even when they aren't followed by type annotations. This is an error in TypeScript, but TS is still able to parse the file.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Input
let a!;

// Prettier stable
let a;

// Prettier main
let a!;
```
