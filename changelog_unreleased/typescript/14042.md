#### Fix to add parentheses for TSTypeQuery in some case (#13546,ã€€#14042 by @onishi-kohei)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
// Input
a as (typeof node.children)[number]
a as (typeof node.children)[]
a as ((typeof node.children)[number])[]

// Prettier stable
a as (typeof node.children)[number];
a as (typeof node.children)[];
a as (typeof node.children)[number][];
```
