#### Support type annotations on auto accessors via `babel-ts` (#14049 by @sosukesuzuki)

[The bug that `@babel/parser` cannot parse auto accessors with type annotations](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/15205) has been fixed. So we now support it via `babel-ts` parser.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
class Foo {
  accessor prop: number;
}
```
