#### No more inserting space between Chinese or Japanese (e.g. hanzi and kana) and western characters (#11597 by @tats-u)

The current behavior of inserting whitespace (U+0020) between Chinese or Japanese (e.g. hanzi/kanji and kana) and western (e.g. alphanumerics) characters is not based on the official layout guidelines in Japanese and Chinese but [non-standard and local one in Chinese](https://github.com/ruanyf/document-style-guide/blob/master/docs/text.md).

It is not the only or the official rule, so Prettier now does not force it. If the document does not apply the rule, Prettier does follow the policy.

For more information of the reason, please see <https://github.com/tats-u/prettier-plugin-md-nocjsp#why-this-plugin-is-needed>, which this patch is based on.

This change includes the following breaking changes:

##### 1. Comply to line breaking rules in Chinese and Japanese

In Chinese and Japanese, some characters (e.g. full stop characters `。`, `．`, and `.`) are not allowed to be placed the head or tail of lines.

- Japanese: <https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#characters_not_starting_a_line>
- Chinese: <https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/#prohibition_rules_for_line_start_end>

👎Bad:

```text
日本語組版には
、禁則処理（
きんそくしょり
）と呼ばれるル
ールがあります
。
```

👍Good:

```text
日本語組版に
は、禁則処理
（きんそくしょ
り）と呼ばれる
ルールがありま
す。
```

In the above sentence:

- `、`, `）`, `ー`, `ょ`, and `。` must not be placed in the head of lines.
- `（` must not be placed in the tail of lines.

Prettier now follows the rule when `proseWrap` is other than `preserve`.

##### 2. Do not break lines inside Korean words

This fixes #6516. Korean uses space to divide words or clauses, and inappropriate words (or clauses) divisions may change the meanings of sentences.

- `노래를 못해요.`: I'm not good at singing.
- `노래를 못 해요.`: I can't sing (for some reason).

Applying this patch, when `proseWrap` is other than `preserve`, Korean sentences are now formatted like those of European languages; successive (i.e. not divided by space) Hangul characters are no longer divided by the newline (U+000A), which may be converted to the space (U+0020) when the content of the document is modified.

`proseWrap` = `always` & `printWidth` = `9`:

Input:

```text
노래를 못해요.
```

Before this patch:

```text
노래를 못
해요.
```

👎Reformat “Before this patch” with `printWidth` = `80`:

```text
노래를 못 해요.
```

After this patch:

```text
노래를
못해요.
```

👍Reformat “After this patch” with `printWidth` = `80`:

```text
노래를 못해요.
```
