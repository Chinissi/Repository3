#### [HIGHLIGHT] Improve handling of whitespace for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (#11597 by @tats-u)

##### Stop inserting spaces between Chinese or Japanese and Western characters

Previously, Prettier would insert spaces between Chinese or Japanese and Western characters (letters and digits). While some people prefer this style, it isn’t standard, and is in fact contrary to official guidelines. Please see [here](https://github.com/tats-u/prettier-plugin-md-nocjsp#why-this-plugin-is-needed) for more details. We decided it’s not Prettier’s job to enforce a particular style in this case, so spaces aren’t inserted anymore, while existing ones are preserved.

The tricky part of this change were ambiguous line breaks between Chinese or Japanese and Western characters. When Prettier unwraps text, it needs to decide whether such a line break should be simply removed or replaced with a space. For that Prettier examines the surrounding text and infers the preferred style.

##### Comply to line breaking rules in Chinese and Japanese

There are rules that prohibit certain characters from appearing at the beginning or the end of a line in [Chinese](https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/#prohibition_rules_for_line_start_end) and [Japanese](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#characters_not_starting_a_line). E.g., full stop characters `。`, `．`, and `.` shouldn’t start a line.

👎Bad:

```text
日本語組版には
、禁則処理（
きんそくしょり
）と呼ばれるル
ールがあります
。
```

👍Good:

```text
日本語組版に
は、禁則処理
（きんそくしょ
り）と呼ばれる
ルールがありま
す。
```

In the above sentence:

- `、`, `）`, `ー`, `ょ`, and `。` must not be placed at the beginning of a line.
- `（` must not be placed at the end of a line.

Prettier now follows these rules when `proseWrap` is other than `preserve`.

##### Do not break lines inside Korean words

Korean uses spaces to divide words, and an inappropriate division may change the meaning of a sentence:

- `노래를 못해요.`: I’m not good at singing.
- `노래를 못 해요.`: I can’t sing (for some reason).

Previously, when `proseWrap` was set to `always`, successive Hangul characters could get split by a line break, which could later be converted to a space when the document is edited and reformatted. This doesn’t happen anymore. Korean text is now wrapped like English.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```markdown
<!-- Input -->
노래를 못해요.

<!-- Prettier stable with --prose-wrap always --print-width 9 -->
노래를 못
해요.

<!-- Prettier stable, subsequent reformat with --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 -->
노래를 못 해요.

<!-- Prettier main with --prose-wrap always --print-width 9 -->
노래를
못해요.

<!-- Prettier main, subsequent reformat with --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 -->
노래를 못해요.
```
