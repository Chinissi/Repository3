#### Preserve multiple spaces in inline code (#13590 by @kachkaev)

Previously, multiple spaces in inline code were collapsed into a single space. This is no longer happening.
Leading or trailing spaces are still collapsed, [according to CommonMark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#backtick-string).
