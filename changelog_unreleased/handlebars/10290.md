#### Move Handlebars support out of alpha to release (#10290 by @dcyriller)

Prettier can now format Handlebars files! ðŸŽ‰

We use [@glimmer/syntax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glimmer/syntax), the
Ember Handlebars parser, to parse these Handlebars files so it should be
compliant with the HTML spec thanks to the Ember team.

A few highlights:

##### Whitespace-sensitive formatting

As you may notice during daily Handlebars works, the following two cases won't
produce the same output:

|                |         html         |       output       |
| -------------- | :------------------: | :----------------: |
| with spaces    | `1<span> 2 </span>3` | 1<span> 2 </span>3 |
| without spaces |  `1<span>2</span>3`  |  1<span>2</span>3  |

This happens because whitespace is significant in inline elements.

For this reason, we cannot safely format

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```hbs
<a href="https://prettier.io/" class={{this.classes}}>Prettier is an opinionated code formatter.</a>
```

into

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```hbs
<a href="https://prettier.io/" class={{this.classes}}>
  Prettier is an opinionated code formatter.
</a>
```

since it may modify the displayed output in the browser.

Instead of breaking your code or just doing nothing, we introduce
_whitespace-sensitive formatting_, which wraps the tags in such a way as to
avoid adding or removing significant whitespace around HTML elements.

There's also an option for the global whitespace sensitivity in case you just
don't care about that whitespace:

`--html-whitespace-sensitivity` (defaults to `strict`)

- `strict` - All whitespace is considered significant.
- `ignore` - All whitespace is considered insignificant.
