1. Choose a folder based on which language your PR is for.

   - For JavaScript, choose `javascript/` etc.
   - For TypeScript specific syntax, choose `typescript/`.
   - If your PR applies to multiple languages, such as TypeScript/Flow, choose one folder and mention which languages it applies to.

2. In your chosen folder, create a file with your PR number: `XXXX.md`. For example: `typescript/6728.md`.

3. Copy the content below and paste it in your new file.

4. Fill in a title, the PR number and your user name.

5. Optionally write a description. Many times itâ€™s enough with just sample code.

6. Change ```jsx to your language. For example, ```yaml.

7. Change the `// Input` and `// Prettier` comments to the comment syntax of your language. For example, `# Input`.

8. Choose some nice input example code. Paste it along with the output before and after your PR.

#### fix(printer-glimmer): preserve path literal segments (#15605 by @maxpowa)

This change fixes scenarios where an input handlebars file containing literal segments would be reformatted to unwrap the literal segments, causing syntax errors in the resulting output.

This also handles a scenario where the input contained deprecated '/' delimited paths, ensuring that those paths are not wrapped with brackets. This exists to prevent breaking an existing test `sub-expressions.hbs`. Handling it this way does lead to some minor ambiguity since glimmer does not support these paths, but the ambiguity is probably better than breaking them entirely.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```hbs
<!-- Input -->
{{input.[funky<api!response]}}
{{input.[this one has spaces]}}
{{input.[anotherone].[0]}}

<!-- Prettier stable -->
{{input.funky<api!response}}
{{input.this one has spaces}}
{{input.anotherone.0}}

<!-- Prettier main -->
{{input.[funky<api!response]}}
{{input.[this one has spaces]}}
{{input.anotherone.[0]}}
