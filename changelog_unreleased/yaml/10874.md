#### Fix #5599, long yaml keys trigger explicit mapping (#10874 by @pdavies)

Fixes #5599, in which long YAML keys cause us to print using yaml's explicit mapping syntax. The intent of the code was to use explicit mapping syntax to accommodate multiline keys, but it had the unintended effect of using explicit mapping syntax for long single-line keys too. This is bad because:

* Doing so has the effect of further increasing the line length
* Explicit mappings are obscure and most people have never seen them. It causes confusion to introduce them needlessly, as shown in the issue
