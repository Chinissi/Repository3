#### Support `max_line_length=off` when parsing `.editorconfig` (#14516 by @josephfrazier)

If an .editorconfig file is in your project and it sets `max_line_length=off` for the file you're formatting,
it will be interpreted as a `printWidth` of `Infinity` rather than being ignored
(which previously resulted in the default `printWidth` of 80 being applied, if not overridden by Prettier-specific configuration).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!-- Input -->
<div className='HelloWorld' title={`You are visitor number ${ num }`} onMouseOver={onMouseOver}/>

<!-- Prettier stable -->
<div
  className="HelloWorld"
  title={`You are visitor number ${num}`}
  onMouseOver={onMouseOver}
/>;

<!-- Prettier main -->
<div className="HelloWorld" title={`You are visitor number ${num}`} onMouseOver={onMouseOver} />;
```
