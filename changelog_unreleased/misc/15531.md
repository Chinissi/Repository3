#### Support all Prettier options in EditorConfig files (#15531 by @benblank)

Any Prettier option can be set via `.editorconfig` by converting its name to snake case and prefixing it with `prettier/`. For example, the option `--trailing-comma none` / `{ trailingComma: "none" }` can be translated to `prettier/trailing_comma = none`.
