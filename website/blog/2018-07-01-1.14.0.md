TODO: update blog post date

This release adds YAML support, pragma (i.e. `/** @prettier */`) support for every language, and improves performance on large files. It also adds support for several new syntax features, and has a few formatting tweaks to make your code even prettier. ✨

<!--truncate-->

## Highlights

### YAML

#### Support YAML ([#4563], [#4742], [#4773], [#4854] by [@ikatyang])

You can now format YAML files! 🎉

The implementation is highly compliant with the [YAML spec](http://yaml.org/spec/), and backed by the excellent [`yaml`](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml) package thanks to [@eemeli]. A few highlights:

##### Word wrap

Just like in Markdown, we’ll hard-wrap prose at 80-characters if it doesn’t affect the meaning of the file.

Input:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
>
  Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valourous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition! The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honour to meet you and you may call me V.
```

Output: (`--prose-wrap always`)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
>
  Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran cast vicariously as both victim
  and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of
  vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this
  valourous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to
  vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the
  violently vicious and voracious violation of volition! The only verdict is
  vengeance; a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and
  veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.
  Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add
  that it's my very good honour to meet you and you may call me V.
```

> Note: the [`proseWrap`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#prose-wrap) option is set to `preserve` by default so you'll have to specify `always` or `never` to enable this feature.

##### Ignore a portion of the file

If for some reason you don’t want to format a part of the YAML file, you can always put an ignore comment before it:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
# prettier-ignore
key  : value
hello: world
```

### Front Matter

#### Format YAML front matter ([#4773] by [@ikatyang])

Prettier can now format `---`-delimited YAML front matter in CSS and Markdown files:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
---
key: value
---

.class {
  display: block;
}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
---
key: value
---

# heading

content
```

### Pragma

#### Support `requirePragma`/`insertPragma` in every language ([#4688], [#4699], [#4713] by [@ikatyang])

Prettier 1.7.0 and 1.8.0 introduced two new options:
[`--require-pragma`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#require-pragma) and
[`--insert-pragma`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#insert-pragma).
However, these options were only supported in a few languages.
Now these options are available in every language, including YAML!

- YAML

  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
  ```yaml
  # @prettier

  key: value
  ```

- CSS/Less/SCSS

  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
  ```css
  /** @prettier */

  .class {
    display: none;
  }
  ```

- GraphQL

  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
  ```gql
  # @prettier

  query Browse($offset: Int) {
    browse(offset: $offset)
  }
  ```

- Vue

  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
  ```html
  <!-- @prettier -->

  <template>
    <div>Template</div>
  </template>
  ```

### JavaScript

#### Never inline decorators unless they're lone parameter decorators ([#4830] by [@suchipi])

Previously, decorators are always inlined since MobX inlined them by convention,
but it seems MobX is the only library follows that convention after investigation.
Prettier 1.14 always puts decorators on their own lines unless they're lone parameter decorators.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Input
@observer
class OrderLine {
  @observable
  price: number = 0;
  @observable amount: number = 1;

  foo(@required name) {
    console.log(name);
  }
}

// Output (Prettier 1.13)
@observer
class OrderLine {
  @observable price: number = 0;
  @observable amount: number = 1;

  foo(@required name) {
    console.log(name);
  }
}

// Output (Prettier 1.14)
@observer
class OrderLine {
  @observable
  price: number = 0;
  @observable
  amount: number = 1;

  foo(@required name) {
    console.log(name);
  }
}
```

#### Handle JSX whitespace separately from fbt whitespace ([#4717] by [@karl])

Previously, JSX whitespaces are always preserved
since Facebook has a custom translation pipeline (`fbt`) that uses JSX syntax but treats whitespaces differently than JSX,
which means we couldn't apply the JSX whitespace rule to format them without breaking the Facebook codebases.
In Prettier 1.14, we now detect Facebook `fbt` tags and handle whitespace for them differently from other JSX tags,
this improves the consistency across different but equivalent inputs.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input and Output from Prettier 1.13
first = (
  <div>
    Text<br />
    More text<br />
    And more<br />
  </div>
);

second = (
  <div>
    Text<br />More text<br />And more<br />
  </div>
);

third = (
  <div>
    Text
    <br />
    More text
    <br />
    And more
    <br />
  </div>
);

// Output from Prettier 1.14
first = (
  <div>
    Text
    <br />
    More text
    <br />
    And more
    <br />
  </div>
);

second = (
  <div>
    Text
    <br />
    More text
    <br />
    And more
    <br />
  </div>
);

third = (
  <div>
    Text
    <br />
    More text
    <br />
    And more
    <br />
  </div>
);
```

When the text separating tags or expressions is just a single character
we display it on a single line where possible.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input and Output from Prettier 1.13
x = (
  <div>
    {hour}:{minute}:{second}
  </div>
);

x = (
  <div>
    {hour}
    :
    {minute}
    :
    {second}
  </div>
);

x = (
  <div>
    {hour}:
    {minute}:
    {second}
  </div>
);

// Output from Prettier 1.14
x = (
  <div>
    {hour}:{minute}:{second}
  </div>
);

x = (
  <div>
    {hour}:{minute}:{second}
  </div>
);

x = (
  <div>
    {hour}:{minute}:{second}
  </div>
);
```

It also improves the output of edges cases like:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
this_really_should_split_across_lines =
  <div>
    before{stuff}after{stuff}after{stuff}after{stuff}after{stuff}after{stuff}after{stuff}after
  </div>

// Output (Prettier 1.13)
this_really_should_split_across_lines = (
  <div>
    before{stuff}after{stuff}after{stuff}after{stuff}after{stuff}after{stuff}after{
      stuff
    }after
  </div>
);


// Output (Prettier 1.14)
this_really_should_split_across_lines = (
  <div>
    before
    {stuff}
    after
    {stuff}
    after
    {stuff}
    after
    {stuff}
    after
    {stuff}
    after
    {stuff}
    after
    {stuff}
    after
  </div>
);
```

### TypeScript

#### Support TypeScript 3.0 ([#4625], [#4757] by [@ikatyang])

A few new features with new syntaxes are added in the upcoming TypeScript 3.0:
[`unknown` type](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/24439) and
[tuples in rest parameters and spread expressions](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/24897).
Prettier 1.14 adds support for them so you can format them when they are released.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// UnknownType
const json: unknown = JSON.parse(jsonText);

// RestType
type Foo = [string, number];
type Bar = [boolean, ...Foo];

// OptionalType
type Baz = [string, number?];
```

### JSON

#### Do not put values on a separate line from the key ([#4852] by [@ikatyang])

Putting long values on new rows is the core feature of Prettier,
but we found that it doesn't improve readability for objects with long string values inside JSON files.
Prettier 1.14 will not move an object's string value regardless if it fits the print width or not.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```json5
// Input
{
  "description": "a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long paragraph"
}

// Output (Prettier 1.13)
{
  "description":
    "a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long paragraph"
}

// Output (Prettier 1.14)
{
  "description": "a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long paragraph"
}
```

### Performance

#### Performance improvement on big files ([#4790], [#4848] by [@sompylasar])

The core feature of Prettier is to wrap lines when it fits print width,
we have to calculate the visual width of every character.
The easiest way to count them is by using the `String#length` property
but it doesn't always work on non-ASCII characters like CJK character,
we need to make it worked on all scenario so we use regular expressions to
replace those 2-char-width characters with 2 whitespaces before counting.
This works fine but it also slows the overall speed
since in most of the case there're only ASCIIs.
In Prettier 1.14, we check if there're only ASCIIs before counting
so we don't need to perform unnecessary string replacement
and this results in 20% speed-up on big files.

## Other changes

### API/CLI

#### Support relative paths for `plugins` and `plusinSearchDirs` in config files ([#4667] by [@ikatyang])

In the prior version, we introduced a new option `pluginSearchDirs` to determine where to find plugins,
which worked well when it's specified in the CLI since it's always relative to `cwd`, but not for config files.
In Prettier 1.14, relative paths for `pluginSearchDirs` and `plugins` in config files are now supported.

#### Do not throw error if `prettier` installed in a directory not named `prettier` ([#4706] by [@asottile])

We added support for globally installed plugins in Prettier 1.13 by searching up the fs tree to
find the nearest `node_modules` from `prettier`. We assumed that there would always be a `prettier` directory
which introduced a bug where you'll get an error if your Prettier was in a differently named directory.
We changed our searching logic in Prettier 1.14 so you should now be able to place it anywhere.

#### Support `filepath` in browser ([#4721] by [@ikatyang])

In the prior version, we added first-class support for running Prettier in the browser, but the only way to
choose which parser to use was via the `parser` option. Prettier 1.14 adds `filepath` support for the browser
API, which will allow it to have the ability to infer which parser to use, just like the Node.js API. This
should be especially useful for web editor applications!

#### Expose `isPreviousLineEmpty` to plugins ([#4748] by [@warrenseine])

Previously, we exposed `isNextLineEmpty` to plugins but not `isPreviousLineEmpty`.
Prettier 1.14 exposes it, this can be useful for some scenarios like C# directives.

### JavaScript

#### Support BigInt literals ([#4697] by [@ikatyang])

[BigInt](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint) is now supported in the `babylon` parser.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
const bigInt = 1n;
```

#### Support `throw` expressions ([#4695] by [@VojtechStep])

[Throw expression](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-throw-expressions) is now supported in the `babylon` parser.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
const assert = x => x || throw new Error('...');
```

#### Break JSX in arrow functions in JSX expressions ([#4601] by [@duailibe])

In the prior version, JSX in arrow functions in JSX expressions followed the general break-if-fit rule,
but it's less readable in the array iteration case.
Prettier 1.14 force breaking them to improve the readability.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
const UsersList = ({ users }) => (
  <section>
    <h2>Users list</h2>
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </section>
)

// Output (Prettier 1.13)
const UsersList = ({ users }) => (
  <section>
    <h2>Users list</h2>
    <ul>{users.map(user => <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>)}</ul>
  </section>
);

// Output (Prettier 1.14)
const UsersList = ({ users }) => (
  <section>
    <h2>Users list</h2>
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </section>
);
```

#### Always expand first argument if the second argument is also a call expression ([#4657] by [@duailibe])

Previously, we have a special case to not break
if there's only 2 parameters in a function and its first parameter is a function,
this can be useful for some scenario but not if the second parameters is also a function,
Prettier 1.14 addresses this issue.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
somePromise.then((args) => {
  this.props.receiveFavoritesActions(id, [].concat(...args));
}, ({ isCanceled }) => !isCanceled && logger.warn(`Ошибка получения действий для продукта: ${id}`));

// Output (Prettier 1.13)
somePromise.then(args => {
  this.props.receiveFavoritesActions(id, [].concat(...args));
}, ({ isCanceled }) => !isCanceled && logger.warn(`Ошибка получения действий для продукта: ${id}`));

// Output (Prettier 1.14)
somePromise.then(
  args => {
    this.props.receiveFavoritesActions(id, [].concat(...args));
  },
  ({ isCanceled }) =>
    !isCanceled && logger.warn(`Ошибка получения действий для продукта: ${id}`)
);
```

#### Add parens for await in bind ([#4778] by [@ikatyang])

Previously, Prettier wrongly removed the necessary parentheses for `await` in bind,
causing its meaning to be different. Prettier 1.14 now preserves the parentheses correctly.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
const doBothThings = async () => {
    const request = doAsyncThing();
    return (await request)::doSyncThing();
};

// Output (Prettier 1.13)
const doBothThings = async () => {
    const request = doAsyncThing();
    return await request::doSyncThing(); // different meaning
};

// Output (Prettier 1.14)
const doBothThings = async () => {
    const request = doAsyncThing();
    return (await request)::doSyncThing();
};
```

#### Allow top level `super` and `await` ([#4823] by [@ikatyang])

`super` and `await` are not allowed to be in places other than classes and async functions respectively,
but it's a valid use case when it comes to [range format](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#range).
Prettier 1.14 allows them to be everywhere.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
super();

await doSomething();
```

#### Blacklist `this` and `super` in functional composition heuristics ([#4836] by [@princed])

In Prettier 1.13, we improved the formatting for functional composition functions (e.g., `pipe`, `compose`, etc.)
by putting their parameters on their own line, but this introduced false positives for functions with the same name in classes.
Prettier 1.14 blacklists `this` and `super` in functional composition heuristics.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
class X {
  x() {
    this.compose(a(), b);
    super.compose(a(), b);
  }
}

// Output (Prettier 1.13)
class X {
  x() {
    this.compose(
      a(),
      b
    );
    super.compose(
      a(),
      b
    );
  }
}

// Output (Prettier 1.14)
class X {
  x() {
    this.compose(a(), b);
    super.compose(a(), b);
  }
}
```

### TypeScript

#### Support `import.meta` ([#4762] by [@ikatyang])

In Prettier 1.13, the version of the TypeScript parser we used did not support parsing the `importMeta` syntax.
We updated our TypeScript parser in Prettier 1.14 so they are now parsed and formatted correctly.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
console.log(import.meta.url);
```

#### Optional property with StringLiteral key in class ([#4762] by [@ikatyang])

In the prior version, the question token in optional property with `StringLiteral` was wrongly removed.
We fixed this bug in Prettier 1.14 so they won't be removed again.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Input
export class ClassExample {
  "a-prop"?: boolean;
}

// Output (Prettier 1.13)
export class ClassExample {
  "a-prop": boolean;
}

// Output (Prettier 1.14)
export class ClassExample {
  "a-prop"?: boolean;
}
```

#### Throw error on multiple super classes in class ([#4762] by [@ikatyang])

Classes are only allowed to have one parent class
but the TypeScript AST allows for multiple
since the `extends` clause shares the same structure with the `implements` clause.
Previously, any extra super classes were silently dropped during the AST
transformation, which may have caused confusion after formatting.
In Prettier 1.14, they are now marked as syntax errors instead.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Input
class Foo extends BarComponent, BazService, QuuxProvider {}

// Output (Prettier 1.13)
class Foo extends BarComponent {}

// Output (Prettier 1.14)
/*
  SyntaxError: Classes can only extend a single class.
*/
```

### Flow

#### Support `.js.flow` extension ([#4777] by [@ikatyang])

[`.js.flow`](https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs/creation/#toc-declaring-a-module)
is the extension for Flow declaration files but previously we didn't recognize it.
In Prettier 1.14, they should be picked up automatically
so you don't need to add `overrides` for them in config files.

### CSS/Less/SCSS

#### Handle newline between front-matter and comment correctly ([#4701] by [@evilebottnawi])

Newlines between front matter and comment are replaced with a whitespace in the prior version.
In Prettier 1.14, we force printing a newline between them.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
/* Input */
---
key: value
---

/* comment */
.class {
  display: none;
}

/* Output (Prettier 1.13) */
---
key: value
---
 /* comment */
.class {
  display: none;
}

/* Output (Prettier 1.14) */
---
key: value
---

/* comment */
.class {
  display: none;
}
```

#### Support at-rule ends with right curly bracket ([#4733] by [@davidgomes])

In the prior version, at-rules that end with `}` were not parsed correctly.
Prettier 1.14 now correctly recognizes and formats them.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
/* Input */
@mixin placeholder {
    &::placeholder {@content}
}

/* Output (Prettier 1.13) */
/*
  SyntaxError: CssSyntaxError Unclosed block
*/

/* Output (Prettier 1.14) */
@mixin placeholder {
  &::placeholder {
    @content;
  }
}
```

### Markdown

#### Preserve email autolink ([#4740] by [@ikatyang])

Autolinks are formatted as their url in the prior version, which is fine.
But there's a special case for email links that they'll be resolved as `mailto:` links.
In Prettier 1.14, email autolinks are preserved.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
<!-- Input -->
<hello@example.com>

<!-- Output (Prettier 1.13) -->
<mailto:hello@example.com>

<!-- Output (Prettier 1.13) -->
<hello@example.com>
```

#### Do not require space after markdown block language name ([#4783] by [@kachkaev])

In Prettier 1.12, we added the support for fenced codeblock lang followed by attributes,
which requires them to be separated by whitespaces.
But this introduced the inconsistency for codeblock highlighting in Atom that
codeblocks are hightlighted but we do not format them.
We updated our detection logic in Prettier 1.14 so they should behave the same now.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
````md
<!-- Input -->
```js{something=something}
const x   =   1;
```

<!-- Output (Prettier 1.13) -->
```js{something=something}
const x   =   1;
```

<!-- Output (Prettier 1.14) -->
```js{something=something}
const x = 1;
```
````

#### Use language aliases to find parser for markdown codeblocks ([#4734] by [@ikatyang])

Previously, we used the language `name` and `extensions` to determine which parser to use for codeblock formatting,
but we found that it's impossible to format `JSON with Comments` codeblocks and keep syntax highlighter working at the same time
since they share the same `.json` extension with `JSON` and the comment syntax highlighting is only available in `JSON5`.
We added the support for using the language `aliases` to find parser in Prettier 1.14
so you should be able to use `jsonc` to format and trigger syntax highlighting for `JSON with Comments` codeblocks.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
````md
<!-- Input -->
```jsonc
// comment
{"a":1}
```

<!-- Output (Prettier 1.13) -->
```jsonc
// comment
{"a":1}
```

<!-- Output (Prettier 1.14) -->
```jsonc
// comment
{ "a": 1 }
```
````

#### Preserve entity for encoded character that its code point is greater than 0xffff ([#4832] by [@ikatyang])

The markdown parser we used (`remark`) parses every encoded character into a single AST node
so that we're able to restore the encoded character by detecting if the value in the AST node is in length of 1.
But there's an exception that a single character can be in length of 2 if its code point is greater than 0xffff
since JavaScript uses UTF-16 (2 bytes) to encode strings.
Prettier 1.14 correctly recognizes these characters so they won't be transformed into the evaluated form.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
````md
<!-- Input -->
&#x1F609;

<!-- Output (Prettier 1.13) -->
😉

<!-- Output (Prettier 1.14) -->
&#x1F609;
````

### Vue

#### Support range format for Vue files ([#4868] by [@ikatyang])

Previously, [range formatting](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html#range) was not available in Vue,
Prettier 1.14 adds support for it.

### GraphQL

#### Preserve linebreak in non-block stringValue ([#4808] by [@ikatyang])

Non-block string values are only allowed to be in a single line
but Prettier 1.13 wrongly transformed the encoded newline char into the real one.
Prettier 1.14 preserves linebreaks in the encoded form.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```gql
# Input
{
  foo(input: {multiline: "ab\ncd"}) { id }
}

# Output (Prettier 1.13)
{
  foo(input: { multiline: "ab
cd" }) {
    id
  }
}

# Output (Prettier 1.14)
{
  foo(input: { multiline: "ab\ncd" }) {
    id
  }
}
```
