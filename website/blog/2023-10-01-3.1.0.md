title: "Prettier 3.1: Better nested ternaries"
---

This release adds indentation back to nested ternaries along with a new `--experimental-ternaries` flag to try a more novel "curious ternary" format that scales better to deeply nested conditionals.

We are keen for [your feedback](https://forms.gle/vwEuboCobTVhEkt66) on the experimental format before it rolls out as the default behavior later this year!

## Highlights

### JavaScript

#### Better nested ternaries

We've resolved our [most-upvoted issue](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5814) by adding indents back to nested ternaries, and we've also added `--experimental-ternaries` that previews more novel behavior we expect to roll out as default in a few months.

To learn more, check out our [blog post](/blog/2023/09/24/curious-ternaries) on the new "curious ternaries" style.

```js
// Prettier v3.0:
const content =
  children && !isEmptyChildren(children)
    ? render(children)
    : renderDefaultChildren();

const fizzbuzz =
  i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0
    ? "fizzbuzz"
    : i % 3 === 0
    ? "fizz"
    : i % 5 === 0
    ? "buzz"
    : String(i);

const reactRouterResult =
  children && !isEmptyChildren(children)
    ? children
    : props.match
    ? component
      ? React.createElement(component, props)
      : render
      ? render(props)
      : null
    : null;

// Prettier v3.1 (default behavior):
const content =
  children && !isEmptyChildren(children)
    ? render(children)
    : renderDefaultChildren();

const message =
  i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0
    ? "fizzbuzz"
    : i % 3 === 0
      ? "fizz"
      : i % 5 === 0
        ? "buzz"
        : String(i);

const reactRouterResult =
  children && !isEmptyChildren(children)
    ? children
    : props.match
      ? component
        ? React.createElement(component, props)
        : render
          ? render(props)
          : null
      : null;

// Prettier v3.1 (with --experimental-ternaries):
const content =
  children && !isEmptyChildren(children) ?
    render(children)
  : renderDefaultChildren();

const fizzbuzz =
  i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0 ? "fizzbuzz"
  : i % 3 === 0 ? "fizz"
  : i % 5 === 0 ? "buzz"
  : String(i);

const reactRouterResult =
  children && !isEmptyChildren(children) ? children
  : props.match ?
    component ? React.createElement(component, props)
    : render ? render(props)
    : null
  : null
```

We hope you like the more readable new default, and we **really** hope you give the new `--experimental-ternaries` option a try for a few weeks and [let us know what you think](https://forms.gle/vwEuboCobTVhEkt66)!
