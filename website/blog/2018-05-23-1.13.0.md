## Highlights

### API/CLI

#### Don't default parser to babylon ([#4528] by [@duailibe])

In Prettier 1.12.1 and lower, when running prettier on a file without a file extension, Prettier would assume the file contained JavaScript. This lead to a couple confusing bugs, namely:

* If you ran prettier on your .git directory, it would reformat files and break your git repo.
* If you tried to run prettier on html files, it would sometimes throw an error, but other times parse the HTML as JSX, and format it as if it was JSX (which was often unsafe).

In Prettier 1.13, we are changing this behavior. If Prettier cannot determine what language a file is from its extension, and the user has not manually specified a parser to use, Prettier will skip the file.

If you need to format files with unsupported or nonstandard extensions, you can use the `--parser` option to specify which parser to use. If you are piping file contents into stdin, make sure to include `--stdin-filepath` so that prettier can use the file extension to detect what language to parse stdin as.

When using the JavaScript API, `prettier.format` and `prettier.formatWithCursor` will now throw an error if you do not include either `parser` or `filepath` in the `options` you pass in. It will also throw an error if you include `filepath` but not `parser` and the correct parser cannot be inferred from the file path.

#### prettier.getFileInfo() method and --file-info CLI option ([#4341] by [@kachkaev])

When invoking Prettier from the API, there was no way to find out if a file should be ignored or not (for `.prettierignore`) so editor integration plugins would have to implement this logic. Also, there was no way to find out if a file is supported by Prettier, so users would need to call Prettier anyway. Now in 1.13 there's a way to check if a parser will be inferred (and which one) and if the file is ignored or not before actually calling `format`.

You can read more about it in the [docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/api.html#prettiergetfileinfofilepath-options).

### JavaScript

#### Inline AngularJS tests that use `inject` ([#4495] by [@thorn0])

Prettier will now keep AngularJS tests with dependency injection in a single line, like it does for our other tests.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input:
it("has calculated the answer correctly", inject(function(DeepThought) {
  expect(DeepThought.answer).toBe(42);
}));

// Output with Prettier 1.12.1:
it(
  "has calculated the answer correctly",
  inject(function(DeepThought) {
    expect(DeepThought.answer).toBe(42);
  })
);

// Output with Prettier 1.13:
it("has calculated the answer correctly", inject(function(DeepThought) {
  expect(DeepThought.answer).toBe(42);
}));
```

#### Nicer line wrapping for d3 ([#4285] by [@1wheel], [#4505] by [@duailibe])

In Prettier 1.12 chains that started with `d3` and other short names were broken into too many lines. In Prettier 1.13, Prettier will not add a newline after the first member if the first member of the chain is shorter than the indentation width.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
d3.select('body')
  .append('circle')
  .at({ width: 30, fill: '#f0f' })
  .st({ fontWeight: 600 })

// Output with Prettier 1.12.1:
d3
  .select("body")
  .append("circle")
  .at({ width: 30, fill: "#f0f" })
  .st({ fontWeight: 600 });

// Output with Prettier 1.13:
d3.select("body")
  .append("circle")
  .at({ width: 30, fill: "#f0f" })
  .st({ fontWeight: 600 });
```

#### Format new `describe.each` table in Jest 23 ([#4423] by [@ikatyang])

Jest 23 introduced a new feature called [data driven tests](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/api.html#describeeachtable-name-fn) where you can describe examples to test in a table. Prettier 1.13 includes support for this feature, and will automatically indent your examples table when using data driven tests.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
describe.each`
a|b|expected
${11   } | ${  1  }|${222}
${1-1}|${2+2}|${ 3333}
${2+1+2}|${1111}|${3}
`('$a + $b', ({a, b, expected}) => {
  test(`returns ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be greater than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeGreaterThan(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be less than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeLessThan(expected);
  });
});

// Output with Prettier 1.13
describe.each`
  a            | b        | expected
  ${11}        | ${1}     | ${222}
  ${1 - 1}     | ${2 + 2} | ${3333}
  ${2 + 1 + 2} | ${1111}  | ${3}
`("$a + $b", ({ a, b, expected }) => {
  test(`returns ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be greater than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeGreaterThan(expected);
  });

  test(`returned value not be less than ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).not.toBeLessThan(expected);
  });
});
```

#### Format functional composition more nicely ([#4431] by[@suchipi])

One of the most requested changes in Prettier was to format function composition better. This pattern is pretty common in functional programming disciplines, like RxJS, Redux, Lodash, and Ramda. In 1.13, Prettier now has an heuristic to detect this type of function composition and format it such that the composed functions are each on their own line. This improves readability when using functions like `pipe`, `compose`, `flowRight`, etc.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
compose(
  sortBy(x => x),
  flatten,
  map(x => [x, x * 2])
);

pipe(
  filter(x => x % 2 === 0),
  map(x => x + x),
  scan((acc, x) => acc + x, 0)
);

// Output with Prettier 1.12.1
compose(sortBy(x => x), flatten, map(x => [x, x * 2]));

pipe(filter(x => x % 2 === 0), map(x => x + x), scan((acc, x) => acc + x, 0));

// Output with Prettier 1.13
compose(
  sortBy(x => x),
  flatten,
  map(x => [x, x * 2])
);

pipe(
  filter(x => x % 2 === 0),
  map(x => x + x),
  scan((acc, x) => acc + x, 0)
);
```

#### Keep parens around do-expressions when needed and improve formatting ([#4479] by [@existentialism])

In Prettier 1.12, there were some cases where Prettier would remove parens around `do` expressions where it was not safe to do so, which would cause the code to be invalid. Those cases are now fixed in 1.13. Also, formatting of `do` expressions has been improved in general with this release.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
(do {});
(do {} + 1);
(1 + do {});

() => do {
  var obj = { foo: "bar", bar: "foo" };
  for (var key in obj) {
    obj[key];
  }
};

// Output with Prettier 1.12
do {
};
do {
} + 1;
1 +
  do {
  };

() =>
  do {
    var obj = { foo: "bar", bar: "foo" };
    for (var key in obj) {
      obj[key];
    }
  };

// Output with Prettier 1.13
(do {});
(do {} + 1);
1 + do {};

() => do {
  var obj = { foo: "bar", bar: "foo" };
  for (var key in obj) {
    obj[key];
  }
};
```

### Flow

#### Print classes mixins and implements correctly ([#4326] by [@existentialism])

Before 1.13, Prettier would incorrectly remove `mixins` and `implements` from flow libdef classes, which would change the meaning of the code. This has been fixed in 1.13.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
declare class A implements B {}
declare class C mixins D {}

// Output with Prettier 1.12
declare class A {}
declare class C {}

// Output with Prettier 1.13
declare class A implements B {}
declare class C mixins D {}
```

#### Added support for the nullish coalescing operator, literal numeric separator ([#4536] by [@vjeux])

These new features were already supported when using the Babylon parser, now Prettier 1.13 added support for them when using the Flow parser.

### TypeScript

#### Added support for TSImportType ([#4429] and [#4438] by [@ikatyang])

A new feature added in TypeScript 2.9 for describing the shapes of a module imported dynamically.

```ts
// Input
export const x:import(   "./foo"   )={x:0,y:0};

export let y:import("./foo2"   ).Bar.I={a:"",b:0};

export let shim:typeof import(   "./foo2")={Bar: Bar2};

// Output with Prettier 1.13
export const x: import("./foo") = { x: 0, y: 0 };

export let y: import("./foo2") = { a: "", b: 0 };

export let shim: import("./foo2") = { Bar: Bar2 };
```

#### Added support for generic JSX element ([#4268] by [@ikatyang])

Another feature added in TypeScript 2.9 is the support for generics in JSX elements and Prettier 1.13 can now format them.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Example:
<MyComponent<number> data={12} />
```

#### Added support for TaggedTemplateExpression typeParameters ([#4353] by [@ikatyang])

Also added in TypeScript 2.9, it's now possible to pass generics to tagged template expressions.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Example:
export const RedBox = styled.div<{ foo: string }>`
  background: red;
  ${props => props.foo};
`;
```

### JSON

#### Split JSON and JSON5 ([#4367] and [#4371] by [@ikatyang], [#4333] by [@duailibe])

JSON5 is a superset of JSON that supports comments, trailing commas and unquoted property keys. Some files (like `.babelrc`) use JSON5, so comments, trailing commas, and unquoted property keys are allowed in those files. Other files (like `package.json`) do not use JSON5, so comments, trailing commas, and unquoted property keys are not allowed. Prettier previously had one parser and printer called `JSON` which was used for both, but maintaining both together led to some subtle bugs being introduced, notably around `/* @prettier */` pragma comment detection and insertion. With these two split apart, these bugs are fixed and prettier is more robust.

#### Added 'json-stringify' parser for JSON.stringify formatting ([#4450] by [@ikatyang])

One common complain with prettier was that it would format `package.json` and `package-lock.json` differently from how `npm` and `yarn` would, so if you ran an `npm` or `yarn` command, it could introduce prettier violations, and editing `package.json` could add line breaks that would later be removed when you next ran an `npm` or `yarn` command. This led to a lot of unnecessary diff noise and a bad user experience. In Prettier 1.13, a new parser/printer called `json-stringify` has been added that behaves the same as `JSON.stringify`, so that changes will not flip-flop back and forth when using prettier and npm/yarn. Also, this is now the default parser/printer for `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, so if you upgrade to the latest version of prettier, these noisy diffs will stop appearing without any configuration change on your part.

### Markdown

#### Change unordered list symbol to hyphen ([#4440] by [@ikatyang])

With the release of Markdown support in Prettier, we used [GitHub BigQuery data](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/github) and discovered that the `*` symbol was marginally more used than `-` for unordered lists. Since then, we have received massive feedback from the community that the `-` is actually preferred. Prettier 1.13 will now format unordered lists using the `-` symbol.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```markdown
<!-- Input -->
* Top level list item 1
* Top level list item 2
  * Nested List item 1
  * Nested List item 2
    * Sub-Nested List item 1
    * Sub-Nested List item 2

<!-- Output with Prettier 1.12.1 -->
* Top level list item 1
* Top level list item 2
  * Nested List item 1
  * Nested List item 2
    * Sub-Nested List item 1
    * Sub-Nested List item 2

<!-- Output with Prettier 1.13 -->
- Top level list item 1
- Top level list item 2
  - Nested List item 1
  - Nested List item 2
    - Sub-Nested List item 1
    - Sub-Nested List item 2
```

#### Preserve Liquid tags contents ([#4484] by [@duailibe])

Liquid is a templating language popular among static site generators such as Jekyll. In Prettier 1.12.1, Liquid tags in markdown files were not properly handled, because Prettier thought they were just text. So it would format them as text, which would often break what the tags were supposed to do. Now Prettier 1.13 understands Liquid tags and will not change their contents.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```markdown
<!-- Input -->
{% include_relative _installations/tarball.md %}

{% cloudinary nice_prefix_-_for_the_filename.jpg %}

<!-- Output with Prettier 1.12 -->
{% include_relative \_installations/tarball.md %}

{% cloudinary nice*prefix*-\_for_the_filename.jpg %}

<!-- Output with Prettier 1.13 -->
{% include_relative _installations/tarball.md %}

{% cloudinary nice_prefix_-_for_the_filename.jpg %}

```

#### Break link definitions onto multiple lines when needed ([#3531] by [@j-f1])

Link definitions will be broken onto multiple lines when used with `--prose-wrap always` if they exceed the print width.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```markdown
<!-- Input -->
[just-url]: https://example.com
[url-with-short-title]: https://example.com "title"
[url-with-long-title]: https://example.com "a long, long title. It's really really long. Here have words."

[long]: https://example.com/a-long-url/another-segment/yet-another-segment/a-really-long-file-name.php.aspx
[long-with-title]: https://example.com/a-long-url/another-segment/yet-another-segment/a-really-long-file-name.php.aspx "look a title!"

<!-- Output with Prettier 1.12 -->
[just-url]: https://example.com
[url-with-short-title]: https://example.com "title"
[url-with-long-title]: https://example.com "a long, long title. It's really really long. Here have words."
[long]: https://example.com/a-long-url/another-segment/yet-another-segment/a-really-long-file-name.php.aspx
[long-with-title]: https://example.com/a-long-url/another-segment/yet-another-segment/a-really-long-file-name.php.aspx "look a title!"

<!-- Output with Prettier 1.13 -->
[just-url]: https://example.com
[url-with-short-title]: https://example.com "title"
[url-with-long-title]:
  https://example.com
  "a long, long title. It's really really long. Here have words."
[long]:
  https://example.com/a-long-url/another-segment/yet-another-segment/a-really-long-file-name.php.aspx
[long-with-title]:
  https://example.com/a-long-url/another-segment/yet-another-segment/a-really-long-file-name.php.aspx
  "look a title!"
```

### GraphQL

#### Don't add new lines after unless present in GraphQL ([#4512] by [@ad1992])

In Prettier 1.12, we would always print a new line between top level definitions. In 1.13 it will stop printing new lines, but will preserve new lines if present in the source. This behavior is similar to how Prettier formats JavaScript.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```graphql
# Input
type TypeA {
  fieldA: string
}
type TypeB {
  fieldB: string
}

type TypeC {
  fieldC: string
}

# Output with Prettier 1.12.1
type TypeA {
  fieldA: string
}

type TypeB {
  fieldB: string
}

type TypeC {
  fieldC: string
}

# Output with Prettier 1.13
type TypeA {
  fieldA: string
}
type TypeB {
  fieldB: string
}

type TypeC {
  fieldC: string
}
```

## Other changes

### API/CLI

#### Don't format range if required pragma is missing in the file ([#3996] by [@josephfrazier])

In Prettier 1.12, if a file didn't have a pragma and Prettier was called only for a range with `--require-pragma`, Prettier would format it anyway. Now Prettier will check if the file has the pragma even when only formatting a range.

### JavaScript

#### Apply destructuring rules in functions to catch param ([#4385] by [@duailibe])

In 1.12 we formatted destructuring in `catch` arguments like destructuring in assignments, but the code looks better if we treat it like destructuring in function parameters instead, so we made that change:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
try {
  doSomething();
} catch ({data: {message}}) {
  handleError(message.errors);
}

try {
  doSomething();
} catch ({data: {message: {errors}}}) {
  handleError(errors);
}

// Output with Prettier 1.12.1
try {
  doSomething();
} catch ({
  data: { message }
}) {
  handleError(message.errors);
}

try {
  doSomething();
} catch ({
  data: {
    message: { errors }
  }
}) {
  handleError(errors);
}

// Output with Prettier 1.13
try {
  doSomething();
} catch ({ data: { message } }) {
  handleError(message.errors);
}

try {
  doSomething();
} catch ({
  data: {
    message: { errors }
  }
}) {
  handleError(errors);
}
```

#### Escape backslashes correctly for Markdown in JS ([#4381] by [@ikatyang])

Prettier 1.12.1 was incorrectly removing backslashes in Markdown template literals in some cases. Now in 1.13, Prettier will print them correctly.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
markdown`
  const cssString = css\`
    background-color: \$\{color('base')\}
  \`;
`
// Output with Prettier 1.12.1
markdown`
  const cssString = css\`background-color: ${color('base')}\`;
`;

// Output with Prettier 1.13
markdown`
  const cssString = css\`background-color: \$\{color('base')\}\`;
`;
```

#### Support styled-components Foo.extend.attrs()`` ([#4434] by [@duailibe])

In Prettier 1.12.1, Prettier did not detect that the template literal passed to the `styled-components` function `Foo.extends.attrs()` was CSS. In 1.13, Prettier now supports this syntax and will format the contents of the template literal as CSS.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
Button.extend.attr({})`
border-color : black;
`;

// Output with Prettier 1.12
Button.extend.attr({})`
border-color : black;
`;

// Output with Prettier 1.13
Button.extend.attr({})`
  border-color: black;
`;
```

#### Added support for the GraphQL comment tag ([#4395] by [@tjallingt])

We format GraphQL in tagged template literals but there are GraphQL libraries that use untagged template literals. Many GraphQL editor plugins have settled on using the comment `/* GraphQL */` before an untagged template literal to detect GraphQL. In 1.13, Prettier now also detects that comment and formats the GraphQL code.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
const query = /* GraphQL */`
      {
    user(   id :   5  )  {
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
`;

// Output with Prettier 1.13
const query = /* GraphQL */ `
  {
    user(id: 5) {
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
`;
```

#### Format Angular Component styles ([#4361] by [@JamesHenry])

Prettier 1.13 formats the inline styles of Angular components.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
@Component({
       selector: 'app-test',
  styles: [   `

 :host {
   color: red;
 }
 div { background: blue
 }
`

]
})
class     TestComponent {}

// Output with Prettier 1.13
@Component({
  selector: "app-test",
  styles: [
    `
      :host {
        color: red;
      }
      div {
        background: blue;
      }
    `,
  ],
})
class TestComponent {
```

### Markdown

#### Remove newline in empty .md files ([#4388] by [@huyvohcmc])

In Prettier 1.12.1, Prettier would output a file with two lines when formatting an empty markdown file. This is now fixed in 1.13.

#### Prevent merge continuous CJK text with `--prose-wrap preserve` ([#4504] by [@ikatyang])

When using `--prose-wrap preserve`, Prettier will no longer merge continuous CJK text broken across multiple lines.

### CSS/SCSS/Less

#### Fix empty front-matter ([#4392] and [#4457] by [@eliasmeire])
