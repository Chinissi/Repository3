-There are few requirements for adding in a new workflow, which we'll need to review before we merge:
+Before merging a new workflow, the following requirements need to be met:
 
 - Should be as simple as is needed for the service.
 - There are many programming languages and tools out there. Right now we don't have a page that allows for a really large number of workflows, so we do have to be a little choosy about what we accept. Less popular tools or languages might not be accepted.

+# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
+# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when a release is created
+#
+# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
+#
+# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
+#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
+#    Replace the value of `ECR_REPOSITORY` in the workflow below with your repository's name.
+#    Replace the value of `aws-region` in the workflow below with your repository's region.
+#
+# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
+#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
+#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
+#    Replace the values for `service` and `cluster` in the workflow below with your service and cluster names.
+#
+# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
+#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
+#    Replace the value of `task-definition` in the workflow below with your JSON file's name.
+#    Replace the value of `container-name` in the workflow below with the name of the container
+#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
+#
+# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
+#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
+#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.
