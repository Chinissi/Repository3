  Description: optional if the `Title` is enough to explain everything.

Examples:

#### TypeScript: Correctly handle `//` in TSX ([#5728] by [@JamesHenry])

Previously, putting `//` as a child of a JSX element in TypeScript led to an error
because it was interpreted as a comment. Prettier master fixes this issue.

<!-- prettier-ignore --\>
```js
// Input
const link = <a href="example.com">http://example.com</a>

// Output (Prettier stable)
// Error: Comment location overlaps with node location

// Output (Prettier master)
const link = <a href="example.com">http://example.com</a>;
```

### Handlebars: Avoid adding unwanted line breaks between text and mustaches ([#6186] by [@gavinjoyce])

Previously, Prettier added line breaks between text and mustaches which resulted in unwanted whitespace in rendered output.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```hbs
// Input
<p>Your username is @{{name}}</p>
<p>Hi {{firstName}} {{lastName}}</p>

// Output (Prettier stable)
<p>
  Your username is @
  {{name}}
</p>
<p>
  Hi
  {{firstName}}
  {{lastName}}
</p>

// Output (Prettier master)
<p>
  Your username is @{{name}}
</p>
<p>
  Hi {{firstName}} {{lastName}}
</p>
```
