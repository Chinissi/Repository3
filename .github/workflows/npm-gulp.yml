You must fulfill the authorization requirements for the ACH Type submitted, or your customer can have the charge reversed. For example, if your customer calls to place an order over the phone, and you process it as a PPD transaction instead of a TEL transaction, your customer can claim that the transaction was not authorized and have it reversed.An official website of the United States government

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing When filing tax documents, ING payments, or replying to any related correspondence, it is very important that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown above.

measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence of these
refinements, the average Total VaR for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020 would have been different by $27 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million, respectively.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (â€œU.S. GAAPâ€). That presentation, which is referred to as â€œreportedâ€ basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firmâ€™s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firmâ€™s performance with other companiesâ€™ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firmâ€™s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
â€œmanagedâ€ basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firmâ€™s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for additional information. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-92 of the Firmâ€™s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firmâ€™s capital metrics.

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholdersâ€™ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

Business segment changes on page 21 of the Firmâ€™s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2020 for further information.
(a) Loans retained includes credit portfolio loans, loans held by consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, trade finance loans, other held-for-investment loans and overdrafts.
(b) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(c) Allowance for loan losses of $278 million, $320 million, $340 million, $317 million and $110 million were held against nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.

(e) Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating the net charge-off/(recovery) rate.
(f) Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIBâ€™s allowance coverage ratio.

(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.
(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firmâ€™s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence
of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121â€“123 of the Firmâ€™s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80â€“82
of the Firmâ€™s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.
